    <p>Here is a simple skinning trick I like to use, which comes in handy for a lot of different rigging&nbsp;situations.</p>
<p>In the images below, I was rigging a wolf&#8217;s tongue with spline <span class="caps">IK</span> that needed to be very flexible. (If you count, you&#8217;ll notice that there are 12 controllers. 4 main controllers and 8 extra offset controllers to bend and twist the tongue into a variety of shapes.) The skinning was proving to be tedious, because the geometry kept collapsing and self-colliding. So here is what I&nbsp;did:</p>
<p><strong>The Scenario</strong>: You have some tongue geometry (or other semi-flat geometry) which needs to be very flexible but the rig has a lot of bones and painting accurate weights is tedious and&nbsp;error-prone!</p>
<p><img src="http://chrislesage.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/wolf_tongue_colliding.jpg" alt="" title="wolf_tongue_colliding" width="360" height="312" class="size-full wp-image-185" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look at that unsightly and embarrassing&nbsp;interpenetration!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Use a poly plane or other simplified geometry as a proxy. Fit it inside the geometry, and skin that instead. When you are done painting, use Copy Skin Weights to copy the weights from the proxy geometry to the full&nbsp;geometry.</p>
<p>The settings I use for Copy Skin Weights&nbsp;are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Surface Association: <strong>Closest point on&nbsp;surface</strong></li>
<li>Influence Association 1: <strong>Closest&nbsp;Joint</strong></li>
<li>Influence Association 2: <strong>Closest&nbsp;Bone</strong></li>
<li>Influence Association 3: <strong>Name</strong> (This 3rd entry is usually optional and makes no difference. When copying from the same geometry, like a body to a body, use &#8220;One to One&#8221;&nbsp;instead.)</li>
<li>Normalize: <strong>Not&nbsp;checked</strong></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>The final result is fast and&nbsp;flexible</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This makes it very easy for both sides of the tongue to have the same weighting, without tedious painting, which means it will twist and bend a lot further without self-colliding. When your geometry has a lot of folds and wrinkles it is also a lot easier to get your brush along the flat, uniform geometry of a plane. This technique also works in any 3D package which supports copying weights from one object to another. In <span class="caps">XSI</span> you can do the exact same thing using <span class="caps">GATOR</span>.</p>
<p>I have also used this technique to copy weights from a stretched sphere to weight complex hair geometry. You could also use it to copy weights from low-res geometry to high-res geometry. You will likely have to do a bit of cleaning up afterwards, but it could be a good way to get 90% of your weight painting done very&nbsp;quickly.</p>
<p>When you are done, you can simply delete the geometry, or tuck it away in a hidden group for later editing. My next goal with this is to figure out a way to copy weights locally on complex geometry. For example, if the tongue is attached to the body, how would you grab just the tongue&nbsp;weights?</p>

<p><strong><a href="#21" title="2012-02-14 16:14:58">Chris</a>:</strong> Ah cool! I didn&#8217;t realize that. It works very well! If you needed to select very complex geometry or wanted to paint selection, I suppose you could create a script that would store your vertex selections, one object at a time, and then re-select them when you are ready to copy the weights. Thanks for the tip&nbsp;Ehsan!</p>
<p><strong><a href="#19" title="2012-02-13 14:05:21">Matt Murray</a>:</strong> Sweet! Thanks for the tip&nbsp;:D</p>
<p><strong><a href="#20" title="2012-02-14 08:12:22">Ehsan <span class="caps">HM</span></a>:</strong> Hi, Thanks for sharing dude. To copy weights locally on complex geometry, you could use the same technique but you should select the vertices of the destination geo. Selecting is a bit tricky though but you can select both geometries first and isolate them. select you proxy geo then hide it&#8217;s display layer and shift select vertices of the destination geo. You might find an easier solution but this is what I came with so far and it works. :)&nbsp;Cheers.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#27" title="2012-03-09 16:35:40">Chris</a>:</strong> Another useful application: You can&#8217;t (as far as I can tell) paint weights or smooth skin weights on a lattice. But you can definitely copy weights from geometry to a&nbsp;lattice!</p>
<p><strong><a href="#40" title="2012-12-19 18:51:41">like</a>:</strong> Hi there! I could have sworn I’ve been to this site before but after looking at some of the articles I realized it’s new to me. Nonetheless, I’m definitely delighted I came across it and I’ll be book-marking it and checking back&nbsp;often!</p>
<p><strong><a href="#85" title="2013-10-06 21:06:05">Armin Halac</a>:</strong> Hi Chris, very useful technique. Just saved me a ton of work on skinning an elephants ear.&nbsp;Cheers!</p>
